# Sol Mate service

This service powers the [Sol Mate GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-QIydQSFRm-sol-mate). It uses Modal because it's one of the easiest ways to run a simple service like this.

The output has been specifically formatted in a way that helps GPT visually describe the weather to DallÂ·E. This output can probably be used to describe the weather for any other LLM-related purpose.

## Running it

Make sure you have Modal installed:

```
pip install modal
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```
pip install ephem pytz requests
```

(You may use a virtual environment for this, up to you.)

For now you'll need to update `blixt` in the code to your own username.

And finally you can run it to see that it works:

```
$ modal run sol_mate.py
